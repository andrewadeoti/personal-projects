Instructions:

Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.

In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until they become translucent.

Add minced garlic to the onions and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

Add minced beef to the pan. Break it up with a spatula and cook until browned.

Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes.

Pour in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.

Simmer the sauce on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a bit of water.

Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

Serve the Bolognese sauce over the cooked spaghetti.

Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese.

Enjoy your homemade Spaghetti Bolognese!
